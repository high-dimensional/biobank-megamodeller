## What is this repository for?
We quantify the individual-level legibility of common biological and pathological characteristics from models of the structurally and functionally imaged human brain. The process illuminates what can—and what plausibly cannot be—predicted from current neuroimaging with large-scale data and state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. More informative imaging and/or more powerful models will likely be needed to decipher individual-level biological and common pathological characteristics in the human brain. We make all models and code openly available.
